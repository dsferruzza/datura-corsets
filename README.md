## Requirements

You need `ghc` (and `hakyll` module from cabal) to compile `site.hs`.

The `compile.bat` script also needs `upx` to be either in the path or in the same directory (see http://upx.sourceforge.net/).
This is only used to reduce the size of the final executable (so it is optional).

To be able to build the website, you need `convert` from ImageMagick to be either in the path or in the same directory (see http://imagemagick.org/).
